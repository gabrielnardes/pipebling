# ⚠️ Still in progress

## 🖥️ Project name: _Pipebling: The Integration_.

## 🤔 Why did you made this project?

I wanted to learn API's integration. Got the idea from this [repository](https://github.com/leonardo-jesus/pipedrive-bling-integration).

## 💬 What is it?

An integration between Pipedrive and Bling API's. I will put some other goals in the future, but the major feature is to search for won deals in Pipedrive, and send a buy order to Bling. Ideally, you will be able to do this in two ways, by a manual press of a button, or by setting a Webhook on Pipedrive.
